In a volume of 2000 m3 of CF4 at normal pressure and room temperature, which corresponds to a mass of 7.4 ton, we expect ~ 3300 of such events per year. The detector can give the spectrum of the low energy neutrinos from the Sun and it can identify solar neutrinos of different origin: pp, 7Be, and, eventually, 8B. We find that 14C is a possible severe source of background: it is necessary to have a ratio 14C/12C lower than 10−19 in order to be able to identify the pp neutrinos."

	abstract = {Optical readout of large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) with multiple Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) amplification stages has shown to provide very interesting performances for high energy particle tracking. Proposed applications for low-energy and rare event studies, such as Dark Matter search, ask for demanding performance in the keV energy range. The performance of such a readout was studied in details as a function of the electric field configuration and GEM gain by using a 55Fe source within a 7 litre sensitive volume detector developed as a part of the R&D for the CYGNUS project. Results reported in this paper show that the low noise level of the sensor allows to operate with a 2 keV threshold while keeping a rate of fake-events lesser than 10 per year. In this configuration, a detection efficiency well above 95% along with an energy resolution (σ) of 18%  is obtained for the 5.9 keV photons  demonstrating the very promising capabilities of this technique.}

	abstract = {The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix contains an array of 256  ×  256 square pixels with pitch 55 μm. In addition to high spatial granularity the single quantum counting detector Timepix can provide also energy or time information in each pixel. This device is a powerful tool for radiation and particle detection, imaging and tracking. A new readout interface for silicon pixel detectors of the Medipix family has been developed in our group in order to provide a higher frame rate and enhanced flexibility of operation. The interface consists of a field programmable gate array, a USB 2.0 interface chip, DAC, ADC and a circuit which generates bias voltage for the sensor. The main control system is 
placed in the FPGA circuit which fully controls the Timepix device. This 
approach offers an easy way how to include new functionality and extended 
operation. The interface for Timepix supports all operation modes of the 
detector (counting, TOT, timing). The FITPix is a successor of the USB 1.22 
Interface and the electronic readout is built with the latest available 
components, which allows achieving up to 90 frames per second with a single 
detector. The frame rate is about 20 times faster compared to the previous 
system while it maintains all same capabilities supported. In addition 
FITPix newly enables an adjustable clock frequency and hardware triggering 
which is a useful tool when there is the need for synchronized operation of 
multiple devices. Three modes of hardware trigger have been implemented: 
hardware trigger which starts the measurement, hardware trigger which 
terminates the measurement and hardware trigger which controls measurement 
fully. The entire system is fully powered through the USB bus. FITPix 
supports also readout from several detectors in chain in which case just an 
external power source is required. FITPix is a fully flexible device and the 
user needs no other equipment. FITPix combines high performance and mobility 
and it opens new fields of applications. The current version of the FITPix 
interface has dimension 45 mm  ×  60 mm.}

	abstract = {We present the measurement of negative ion drift velocities   and mobilities for innovative particle tracking detectors using gas   mixtures based on SF6. This gas has recently received attention   in the context of directional Dark Matter searches, thanks to its   high Fluorine content, reduced diffusion and multiple species of   charge carriers, which allow for full detector fiducialization. Our   measurements, performed with a 5 cm drift distance Negative Ion Time   Projection Chamber, show the possibility of negative ion operation   in pure SF6 between 75 and 150 Torr with triple thin GEM   amplification, confirming the attractive potentialities of this   gas. Above all, our results with the mixture He:CF4:SF6 360:240:10 Torr demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of   SF6− negative ion drift and gas gain in He at nearly   atmospheric pressure, opening very interesting prospects for the   next generation of directional Dark Matter detectors.}

abstract = "The DAFNE Beam Test Facility (BTF) is a beam transfer line optimized for the production of electron or positron bunches, in a wide range of multiplicities and down to single-electron mode, in the energy range between 50 and 800MeV. The typical pulse duration is 10ns and the maximum repetition rate is 50Hz. The facility design has been optimized for detector calibration purposes. The BTF has been successfully commissioned in February 2002 and started operation in the same year in November. The schemes of operation, the commissioning results, as well as the first users’ experience are reported here."
