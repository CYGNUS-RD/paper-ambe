The aim of the superclustering procedure is to collect the majority of
the pixels belonging to a track which is long and, eventually, with
an irregular pattern. The main limitation of \idbscan to follow a long
track is mainly originated by the non uniform energy deposition along
the path length.  As can be clearly seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:basic_clusters} (right), or even in the example of a raw
image of an event with two long cosmic rays in
Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (right), clusters with larger energy
release are followed by regions along the path with a lower or even a
zero release.  These local minima are sometimes as large, in the 2D
space, as the typical size of the $\epsilon$ parameter of
\dbscan~\cite{dbscan}. Despite the low electronic noise of the
ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera sensor, the energy releases in these local
minima are similar in magnitude to the average single-pixel noise.
The \idbscan is limited in connecting the full length of an extended
path, because of two reasons. First, inflating $\epsilon$ parameter as
much as needed to cover the areas of local minima conflicts with the
need to reject noise around the cluster.  The \idbscan parameters were
optimized for the \lemon running conditions to collect most of the
signals of $E \approx 5$\keV and to reject the typical noise of
$\approx 1$ photon per pixel. This avoids collecting extra noise in
the cluster, biasing the energy scale and worsening its resolution,
and keeps the rate of fake clusters at a negligible level.  This is
studied in great detail in Ref.~\cite{iDBSCAN}.  Second, the iterative
nature of the algorithm with very different parameters for each
iteration, each tuned for very different intensity, makes it
convenient and efficient for a deposition of a fixed energy density
(like the spots originating from the \fe source), but not for the
cases as in Fig.~\ref{fig:basic_clusters} (right), where the same
track is split in several parts, with some of them in different
iterations.  This requires a method that can continuously follow the
pattern of the track, profiting of the full resolution image, where
the {\it gradients} of the energy deposition along the track
trajectory are smaller than the ones in the transverse
direction. Moreover, executing any of the most common clustering methods on the
full $1024\times1024$ image is not manageable CPU-wise, due to the huge
pixel combinatorics.

The procedure adopted for the final supercluster reconstruction in the
\lemon detector started from defining the \textit{interesting regions}
in the image that may contain pixels from an energy deposit. These are
identified by the basic cluster algorithm \idbscan previously
described, which is applied on the $512\times512$ reduced-resolution
image. In order to gather the peripheral pixels, especially along the
track trajectory where breaks into small basic clusters may have happened,
a window of $5\times5$ pixels is considered, around each pixel
belonging to a macro-pixel clustered in a basic cluster. A full
resolution image formed only by the interesting pixels passing the
simple initial filtering described in Sec.~\ref{sec:zerosuppression}
was created.  The gradients of the intensity $N_{ph}$ in such image were
computed pixel-by-pixel to look for the edge region where the image
turns from signal to noise-only:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gradient}
\vert\vert\nabla(N_{ph})\vert\vert =
\sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial N_{ph}}{\partial x}\right)^2
  +\left(\frac{\partial N_{ph}}{\partial y}\right)^2},
\end{equation}
%
while the gradient direction is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:graddir}
  \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\partial N_{ph}}{\partial y}/\frac{\partial N_{ph}}{\partial x}\right).
\end{equation}
%
In order to reduce the effect of the noise which makes the first
derivatives in Eq.~\ref{eq:gradient} to fluctuate, a Gaussian filter
is applied, with a 5$\sigma$ threshold, where $\sigma$ is the SD of
the intensities of the pixels considered.

The superclustering algorithm, applied on the filtered image, is an
application of the \textit{morphological geodesic active
contours}\cite{gac,mgac}, called \gac in the following.  This method
uses an active contour finding, widely used in computer vision, where
the boundary curve $\mathcal{C}$ of an object is detected by
minimizing the \textit{energy} $E$  associated to $\mathcal{C}$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gacenergy}
  E(\mathcal{C}) = \int_{0}^{1} g(N_{ph})(\mathcal{C}(p)) \cdot \vert\mathcal{C}_p\vert dp,
\end{equation}
%where $N_{ph}$ is the number of photons in the pixel,
where $ds=\vert\mathcal{C}_p\vert dp$ is the arc-length parameterization of
the curve in the 2D space, and $g$ is the stopping edge function,
which allows to select the boundary of the cluster.  In the \gac
method used for the \lemon images, the $g$ function is purely
geometrical, and uses the geodesics of the image, \ie, the local
minimal distance path between points with the same gradient, defined
before. The function $g(N_{ph})$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
g(N_{ph}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\alpha\vert\nabla G_\sigma * N_{ph}\vert}},
\end{equation}
which is minimal in the edges of the image.  The $G_\sigma * N_{ph}$ is the
aforementioned $5\sigma$ Gaussian filter, and the parameter $\alpha$,
which regulates the strength of the filtering was tuned on
typical \lemon images to be $\alpha=100$.

This method was chosen because it allows to follow track patterns
that may vary from convex to concave shape, eventually with kinks, \eg
in cases of $\delta$-ray emissions. To improve the shrinking of the
cluster boundary in the cases of tracks turning from concave to convex
along their trail, the \textit{balloon} force~\cite{mgac} is set to
-1, in order to push the contour towards a border in the areas where
the gradient is too small. A number of 300 iterations is used to
evolve the supercluster contour.

The example track shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:basic_clusters} (right) after
the basic clustering step, is shown again in full resolution, zoomed
around the cluster, in Fig.~\ref{fig:super_clusters1} (left). The
output of the superclustering with the \gac algorithm is shown on the
right panel of the same figure. The splitting of the clustering,
present after the basic cluster step, was recovered. The portions with
high density and low density along the path of the energy deposition
were joined together. Other three examples of superclustered images are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:super_clusters2}, in runs without any artificial
radioactive source. The top left panel shows an example of a cosmic
ray track fully reconstructed by the \gac superclustering, which also
includes a $\delta$-ray in the middle of the track length. The top
right panel shows an example of curly track from a candidate of
natural radioactivity interaction; bottom panel shows an example where
both a cosmic ray and a curly track are present. In this case, the
extremes of the long and straight track are still split, but this is
much rarer than after the basic clustering, and it happens when the
local minimal along the trajectories are compatible with noise-only
for more than $\approx$1\unit{cm}.
