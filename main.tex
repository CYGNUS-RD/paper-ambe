\section{Introduction}

The advent of a market of high position resolution and single photon  light sensors can open new opportunity to investigate ultra-low rate phenomena as Dark Matter  (DM) particle  scattering on nuclei in a gaseous  target.

The nature of DM is still one of the key  issues to understand  our Universe. Different models  predicts the existence of neutral particles with a mass of GeV  or higher that would fill our Galaxy. They  could interact with the nuclei present in ordinary matter producing highly ionizing nuclear recoils but with a  kinetic energy as small as  few \keV. Moreover, given the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way towards the Cygnus constellation such nuclear recoils would exhibit a dipole angular distribution in a terrestrial detector.
In this paper we describe the use of a scientific CMOS camera to capture the light emitted by Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) device. The GEMs are located in the TPC gas volume at the anode position and are used to convert the ionization produced in the gas by   the  nuclear recoils into flashes of visible light. The flash of light and its shape  can be located in space adopting a cluster  recognition algorithm. Neutron and  $\gamma$ radiation emitted by radioactive sources are used to  set in motion  atomic electrons and nuclei respectively in the gas volume. Moreover, natural radiation as cosmic rays is leaving a trail of ionization in the gas. They are all producing different  patterns of light emission from the GEMs that can be reconstructed and analyzed. Nuclear recoils can then be efficiently identified down to a few \keV kinetic energy. 
 The study of the optical readout of TPC has been recently conducted with several small size prototypes (NITEC~\cite{JINST:nitec}, ORANGE~\cite{NIM:Marafinietal, bib:jinst_orange2}, \lemon~\cite{bib:eps, bib:ieee17, bib:elba}) with various particles sources. In the following, we report the study of nuclear recoils excited by neutron from a  \ambe source and electron recoils from a \fe source in the gas volume of the  \lemon prototype.

\section{Properties of the gas mixture}

Main parameters of the gas mixtures were studied by means of different software packages. In particular \garfield~\cite{bib:garfield,bib:garfield1} was used to evaluate transport properties for ionized electrons in sensitive volume for an electric field of 500 V/cm.

Because of the diffusion in the gas, electrons produced  a distance $z$ from the GEM, will occupy a region on the GEM surface with a gaussian transverse profile and with a $\sigma_{\mathrm{T}}$ given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff}
\sigma_{\mathrm{T}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathrm{T0}} \oplus D^2_{\mathrm{T}} \cdot z} 
\end{equation}


$D_{\mathrm{T}}$ being the transverse diffusion coefficients calculated to be
$
D_{\mathrm{T}}^{60/40}~=~140~\frac{\mu{\mathrm{m}}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}}.
$

The value of $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{T0}}$ was measured to be about 300~$\mu$m \cite{bib:btf,bib:fe55New}. Therefore, in average, a point-like ionization will result in a spot of 3-4 mm$^2$.

Effective ranges of electron and He-nuclei recoils were calculated
respectively by \GEANTfour~\cite{bib:geant} and
\SRIM~\cite{bib:srim}. Results as a function of particle kinetic
energy are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:range}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item He-nuclei recoils have a sub-millimetre range up to energies
      of 100\keV and are thus expected to produce bright spots with
      sizes mainly dominated by diffusion effects;
    \item low energy (less than 10\keV) electron recoils are in
      general larger then He-nuclei recoils with same energy and are
      expected produce less intense spot-like signals. For a kinetic
      energy of 10\keV, electron range becomes longer than 1\unit{mm}
      and for few tens of \keV, tracks of few centimetres are
      expected.
\end{itemize}

  \end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Experimental layout and data }
\label{sec:layout}
 A 7 liter active sensitive volume TPC  (named \lemon  \cite{paperBTF} ) was employed to detect the particles recoils. The sensitive volume where the ionization electrons are drifting through
features   a  200$\times$240~mm$^2$ elliptical field cage with a 200 mm distance between the anode and the cathode. The anode side is instrumented with a 200$\times$240~mm$^2$ rectangular triple  GEM structure.
Standard LHCb-like \cite{bib:thesis} GEMs  (70~$\mu$m diameter holes and 140~$\mu$m pitch) were used with two 2~mm wide transfer gaps between them. The light emitted from the GEMs is detected with   an ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera \cite{ORCAcamera} through a  $203\times254\times1$ mm$^3$ transparent window and a  bellow with a adjustable length (Fig.\ref{fig:LemonShielded}.  This camera is positioned  at a 52 cm  distance from the outermost  GEM layer and is based on a sCMOS sensor with a high granularity ($2048\times2048$ pixels), very low noise (around two photons per pixel), high sensitivity (70\%  quantum efficiency at  600~nm) and good linearity. This camera is instrumented with a Schneider lens (with an aperture f/0.95 and a focal length of 25~mm). The lens is placed at a distance $d$ of 50.6 cm from the last GEM
in order to obtain a de-magnification
$\delta = (d/f) - 1 = 19.25$ to
image a surface $25.6 \times 25.6$~cm$^2$ onto the
$1.33 \times 1.33$~cm$^2$ sensor.
In this configuration, each pixel
 is therefore imaging  an effective area of 125$\times$125~$\mu$m$^2$ of the GEM layer. The fraction of the light collected by the lens can be evaluated \cite{bib:jinst_orange1} to be $1.7 \times 10^{-4}$.

A semi-transparent mesh was used as a cathode in order to collect light on that side also with a 50$\times$50~mm$^2$ HZC Photonics XP3392 photomultiplier \cite{PMTPhotonics} (PMT) detecting light through a transparent $50\times50\times4$~mm$^3$ fused silica window. More details can be found in ... \textcolor{red}{che citiamo ? Lemon at BTF ? }

  	\label{fig:LemonShielded}
\end{figure}



Typical images frame obtained with a 30 ms exposure time of the sCMOS
camera are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1}. Several light spots
are visible due to different ionization patterns due to different types of particles interacting in the
gas.   Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (left) shows an
image with typical long tracks from cosmic rays travelling through the
full gas volume, where clusters of light with larger  energy deposition are
clearly visible, superimposed to  radioactivity events likely due to natural origin.
Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (right) shows an example of a cleaner event
with one straight cosmic ray track, that can be used for energy
calibration purposes.

The events shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:signals} show images recorded with
the same 30 ms exposure time, but in presence of radioactive
sources. Figure~\ref{fig:signals} (left) shows one example of several
energy spots, characteristic of 5.9 keV energy deposits of a  \fe
radioactive $\gamma$-source.  This is the standard candle for calibration and
performance evaluation of \lemon, and its extensive use is documented in
Ref.~\cite{bib:fe55}. Figure~\ref{fig:signals} (right) shows an event
recorded in presence of the \ambe radioactive source, which emits neutrons in the 
$\alpha \, ^{9}Be \rightarrow \, n ^{12}C  \, \gamma$ reaction.

\lemon was operated in an overground location at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) with  a He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas mixture, the triple GEM system set at a voltage across the GEM sides of {460~V} and an electric field between them of {2.5} kV/cm - using 
six independent HV channels from a CAEN A1257 module
%a HV GEM power supply \cite{Corradi:2007df} 
ensuring stability and monitoring the bias currents with a precision of 20~nA. The gas mixture was kept at atmospheric pressure under continuous flow of about 200~cc/min and with the GEMs operated at \textcolor{red}{2.0} $ \times10^6$ gain. The typical photon yield for this  type of gas mixtures has been measured to be around 0.07 photons per avalanche electron\cite{bib:jinst_orange1, bib:roby, bib:tesinatalia}.

The field cage was powered by a CAEN N1570.\cite{CAENN1570} generating an electric field of 0.5~kV/cm. 

\textcolor{red}{this part was copied by the lemon btf paper - must be revised}
\textcolor{red}{The ORCA Camera I/O has been configured in order to get a pre-trigger, that must occur 80~$\mu$s before the shutter, and to synchronize the PMT signal waveform acquired with an oscilloscope LeCroy 610Zi. Optics and exposure time (30~ms) were optimized to ensure the largest light collection and to avoid events due to the natural radioactivity. Between 100 and 300 images were typically acquired per run. }

A  5cm thick lead shielding was mounted around the \lemon field cage to reduce the natural radioactivity background. From the measurements of the GEM current with and without the lead shielding a reduction of a factor 2  of the total ionization in the sensitive volume  - very likely due to external radioactivity -  was estimated.

 An neutron source, based on a 3.5~$\times~$10$^3$~MBq activity  $^{241}$Am source contained in a Beryllium capsule (\ambe) was placed at a distance of 50~cm from the sensitive volume side. 
 Because of the interactions between $\alpha$ particles produced by the $^{241}$Am and the Beryllium nucluei, the \ambe source isotropically emits:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item photons with an energy of 59\keV produced by $^{241}$Am;
     \item neutrons with a kinetic energy mainly in a range between 1 to 10 MeV;
     \item photons with an energy of 4\MeV produced along with neutrons in the interaction between $\alpha$ and Be nucleus.
 \end{itemize}
 
The presence of a lead shield around the sensitive volume absorbed almost completely the 59~keV photon component. A small faction of them reached the gas through small gaps accidentally present between the bricks.

\section{Cluster pattern recognition}
\label{sec:clustering}
The light produced in the multiplication process in the GEM and
detected by the CMOS sensor is associated in clusters of neighboring
pixels. This is done by following the trail of energy deposition of the particle travelling
through the gas of the sensitive volume. The deposited energy  (that for stopped particles is equivalent to the total energy of the particle)
 is estimated by the amount of the light
collected by the sensor.  Therefore, it is of primary importance to
have a reconstruction algorithm that  includes all  the pixels
hit by the real photons originating from the energy deposits, while
rejecting most of the electronic noise. This can either create fake
clusters or, more likely, add pixels in the periphery of clusters from
real photons, biasing the energy estimate.

The energy reconstruction follows a three-steps procedure: the
single-pixel noise suppression is briefly described in
Section~\ref{sec:zerosuppression}. This is followed by the proper  clustering: first the basic clusters of single small deposits is
described in Section~\ref{sec:basiccl}, then the superclusters, aiming
to follow the track patterns for depositions extended in space, and
seeded by the basic clusters, is described in
Section~\ref{sec:supercl}.

The results of this paper are based on the properties of the
reconstructed superclusters and are described in
Section~\ref{sec:clustershapes}.
