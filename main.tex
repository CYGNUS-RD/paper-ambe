\begin{abstract}
The search for a novel technology able to detect and reconstruct
nuclear recoil events in the \keV energy range has become more and
more important as long as vast regions of high mass WIMP-like Dark
Matter candidate have been excluded.  Gaseous Time Projection Chambers
(TPC) with optical readout are very promising candidate combining the
complete event information provided by the TPC technique to the high
sensitivity and granularity of last generation scientific light
sensors.  A TPC with an amplification at the anode obtained with Gas
Electron Multipliers (GEM) was tested at the Laboratori Nazionali di
Frascati. Photons and neutrons from radioactive sources were employed
to induce recoiling nuclei and electrons with kinetic energy in the
range from 1 to few tens of keV.  A He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas mixture was
used and the light produced during the multiplication in the GEM
channels was acquired by a high position resolution and low noise
scientific CMOS camera and a photomultiplier. A multi-stage pattern
recognition algorithm based on an advanced clustering technique is
presented here. A number of cluster shape observables are used to
identify nuclear recoils induced by neutrons originated from a \ambe
source against X-ray \fe photo-electrons. An efficiency of 18\% to
detect nuclear recoils with a 96\% \fe photo-electrons suppression
with an energy of 5.6\keV is obtained. This makes this optically
readout gas TPC a very promising candidate for future investigations
of ultra-rare events as directional direct Dark Matter searches.

\section{Introduction}
%\textcolor{red}{Uso degli aggettivi in ordine corretto Number Opinion Size Shape Age Color Origin Material Purpose}

%\textcolor{red}{Uso degli aggettivi in ordine corretto Three Ugly Big Long Old Red French Metal Killing Knives }

The advent of a market of high position resolution and single photon
light sensors can open new opportunity to investigate ultra-low rate
phenomena as Dark Matter (DM) particle scattering on nuclei in a
gaseous target.

The nature of DM is still one of the key issues to understand our
Universe \cite{PhysRevLett.39.165,Undagoitia_2015}.  Different models
predicts the existence of neutral particles with a mass of GeV or
higher that would fill our Galaxy. They could interact with the nuclei
present in ordinary matter producing highly ionizing nuclear recoils
but with a kinetic energy as small as few keV. Moreover, given the
motion of the Sun in the Milky Way towards the Cygnus constellation
such nuclear recoils would exhibit a dipole angular distribution in a
terrestrial detector.  In this paper the use of a scientific CMOS
camera to capture the light emitted by Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs)
in a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) device is described. The GEMs are
located in the TPC gas volume at the anode position and are used to
convert the ionization produced in the gas by the nuclear recoils into
flashes of visible light. The emitted light and its spatial
distribution is located in the detector geometry by using a clustering
algorithm. Neutron and $\gamma$ radiation emitted by radioactive
sources are used to set in motion atomic electrons and nuclei,
respectively, in the gas volume. Moreover, natural radiation as cosmic
rays is leaving a trail of ionization in the gas.

All types of interactions produce distinctive patterns of light
emission from the GEMs that can be reconstructed and
analyzed. Therefore, nuclear recoils can be efficiently identified and
separated from different kinds of background down to a few \keV
kinetic energy.  The study of the optical readout of a TPC has been
recently conducted with several small size prototypes
(NITEC~\cite{JINST:nitec}, ORANGE~\cite{NIM:Marafinietal,
  bib:jinst_orange2}, \lemon~\cite{bib:eps, bib:ieee17, bib:elba})
with various particle sources, in the context of the \cygno
project. In the following, the study of nuclear recoils excited by
neutrons from an \ambe source and electron recoils from a \fe source
in the gas volume of the \lemon prototype is presented.



\section{Experimental layout  }
\label{sec:layout}
A 7 liter active sensitive volume TPC (named \lemon) was employed to
detect the particle recoils. A sketch (not to scale) of the detector
setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon} (left), while an image of the
detector in the experimental area is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon}
(right).

\end{figure}
%
The sensitive volume where the ionization electrons are drifting
 features a 200$\times$240\unit{mm$^2$} elliptical field cage
with a 200 mm distance between the anode and the cathode. The anode
side is instrumented with a 200$\times$240\unit{mm$^2$} rectangular
triple GEM structure.  Standard LHCb-like \cite{bib:thesis} GEMs
(70\unit{$\mu$m} diameter holes and 140\unit{$\mu$m} pitch) were used
with two 2\unit{mm} wide transfer gaps between them. The light emitted
from the GEMs is detected with an ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera
\cite{ORCAcamera} through a $203\times254\times1$\unit{mm$^3$}
transparent window and a bellow of adjustable length.  This camera
is positioned at a 52 cm distance from the outermost GEM layer and is
based on a sCMOS sensor with high granularity ($2048\times2048$
pixels), very low noise (around two photons per pixel), high
sensitivity (70\% quantum efficiency at 600\unit{nm}) and good
linearity. This camera is instrumented with a Schneider lens (with an
aperture f/0.95 and a focal length of 25\unit{mm}). The lens is placed
at a distance $d=50.6\unit{cm}$ from the last GEM in order to
obtain a de-magnification $\Delta = (d/f) - 1 = 19.25$ to image a
surface $25.6 \times 25.6$\unit{cm$^2$} onto the $1.33 \times
1.33$\unit{cm$^2$} sensor.  In this configuration, each pixel is
therefore imaging an effective area of 125$\times$125\unit{$\mu$m$^2$}
of the GEM layer. The fraction of the light collected by the lens is
evaluated \cite{bib:jinst_orange1} to be $1.7 \times 10^{-4}$.
%
A semi-transparent mesh was used as a cathode in order to collect
light on that side also with a 50$\times$50\unit{mm$^2$} \textit{HZC
  Photonics XP3392} photomultiplier \cite{PMTPhotonics} (PMT)
detecting light through a transparent $50\times50\times4$\unit{mm$^3$}
fused silica window. More details can be found in Ref.~\cite{paperBTF}.

A 5\unit{cm} thick lead shielding was mounted around the \lemon field
cage to reduce the environmental natural radioactivity
background. From the measurements of the GEM current with and without
the lead shielding, a factor two reduction in the total ionization
within the sensitive volume, very likely due to environmental
radioactivity, was estimated.


\section{Particle images  in \lemon gas volume}

The \lemon detector was operated in an overground location at
Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) with a He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas
mixture, the triple GEM system set at a voltage across the GEM sides
of 460\unit{V} and an electric field between the GEM layers of
2.5\unit{kV/cm}. A six independent HV channels \textit{CAEN A1257}
module
%a HV GEM power supply \cite{Corradi:2007df} 
ensured stability and monitored the bias currents with a precision
of 20\unit{nA}. The gas mixture was kept at atmospheric pressure under
continuous flow of about 200\unit{cc/min} and with the GEMs operated
at $2.0\times10^6$ gain. The typical photon yield
for this type of gas mixtures has been measured to be around 0.07
photons per avalanche electron\cite{bib:jinst_orange1, bib:roby,
  bib:tesinatalia}. The field cage was powered by a \textit{CAEN
  N1570}~\cite{CAENN1570}, generating an electric field of 0.5~kV/cm.
  
The motion of particles within the gas mixtures was studied by means
of different simulation tools. In particular,
\garfield~\cite{bib:garfield,bib:garfield1} program was used to
evaluate the transport properties for ionization electrons in the
sensitive volume for an electric field of 500\unit{V/cm}.

Given the diffusion in the gas, ionization electrons produced at a
distance $z$ from the GEM will distribute over a region on the GEM
surface, having a Gaussian transverse profile with a $\sigma$ given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff}
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2_0 \oplus D^2 \cdot z},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the transverse diffusion coefficient,
calculated to be
%$D_{\mathrm{T}}^{60/40}~=~140~\frac{\mu{\mathrm{m}}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}}$.
$140~\mu{\mathrm{m}}/\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}$.
The value of $\sigma^2_0$ was measured to be about
300\unit{$\mu$m} \cite{bib:btf,bib:fe55New}. Therefore, in average, a
point-like ionization will result in a spot of 3--4\unit{mm$^2$}.

The expected effective ranges of electron and He-nucleus recoils were
evaluated respectively with \GEANTfour~\cite{GEANT4} and with
\SRIM~\cite{bib:srim} simulation programs. The recoil range estimated
from simulation, as a function of the impinging particle kinetic
energy, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:range}. 
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figures/range_ER_NR.pdf}
    \caption{Average ranges for electron and He-nucleus recoils as a
      function of their kinetic energy.  \textcolor{red}{Range

        faccia un plot sul range 3D}
      \label{fig:range}}
      \end{center}
\end{figure}
%
These results show that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item He-nuclei recoils have a sub-millimetre range up to energies
      of 100\keV and are thus expected to produce bright spots with
      sizes mainly dominated by diffusion;
    \item low energy (less than 10\keV) electron recoils are in
      general longer than He-nucleus recoils with same energy and are
      expected to produce less intense spot-like signals. For a
      kinetic energy of 10\keV, the electron range becomes longer than
      1\unit{mm} and for few tens of \keV, tracks of few cm are
      expected.
\end{itemize}


The sCMOS sensor was operated in continuous mode with a global
exposure time of 30\unit{ms}. Typical images are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1}. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figures/pic_run02317_ev8_oriIma_paper}

    \caption{Two typical pictures taken with the sCMOS camera with a
      30\unit{ms} exposure time. Left: cosmic tracks and natural
      radioactivity signals are present. Right: two long cosmic rays
      tracks are present, observed in a data taking run without any artificial source.
      \label{fig:typicalimage1}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The PMT waveform was sent to a digitizer board with a sampling
frequency of 4\unit{GS/s}. The experiment trigger scheme is based on
the PMT signal: if, during the exposure time window, this exhibits a
peak exceeding a threshold of 80\unit{mV}, it is acquired in a time
window of 25\unit{$\mu$s} and the corresponding sCMOS image is stored.
The digitizer is operated in single-event mode. No more than one
signal is recorded in each sCMOS exposure time. Therefore, the PMT
information was mainly exploited to select events with a cosmic ray
track.
%% Forward reference is ugly. The picture is better later, when the difference Fe/cosm is explained.
%% Two examples of acquired waveforms are shown in
%% Fig.~\ref{fig:waveforms}.




Several light
spots are visible with different ionization patterns due to
different types of particles interacting in the gas.
Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (left) shows an image with typical long
tracks from cosmic rays traveling through the full gas volume, where
clusters of light with larger energy deposition are clearly visible,
superimposed to radioactivity events likely due to natural origin.
Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (right) shows an example of a cleaner
event with one straight cosmic ray track, that can be used for energy
calibration purposes.

Two different artificial radioactive sources were employed for testing and studying the detector responses.

\vspace{10pt}

A {\bf neutron} source, based on a $3.5\times10^3$\unit{MBq} activity
$^{241}$Am source contained in a Beryllium capsule (\ambe) was placed
at a distance of 50\unit{cm} from the sensitive volume side.  Because
of the interactions between $\alpha$ particles produced by the
$^{241}$Am and the Beryllium nuclei, the \ambe source isotropically
emits:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item photons with an energy of 59\keV produced by $^{241}$Am;
     \item neutrons with a kinetic energy mainly in a range 1--10\MeV
     \item photons with an energy of 4.4\MeV produced along with
       neutrons in the interaction between $\alpha$ and Be nucleus.
 \end{itemize}
 The presence of a lead shield around the sensitive volume absorbed
almost completely the 59\keV photon component. A small faction of them
reached the gas through small gaps accidentally present between the lead
bricks.

A \fe source emitting {\bf X-rays} with a main energy peak at 5.9\keV.
This is the standard candle for calibration and performance evaluation
of \lemon, and its extensive use is documented in
Ref.~\cite{bib:fe55}.

The events in Fig.~\ref{fig:signals} show images recorded with the
same 30~ms exposure time, in presence of the two sources. The left
panel shows an example of several light spots, characteristic of
energy deposits due to \fe low energy photons.  The right panel shows
a frame recorded in presence of the \ambe radioactive source: the
short and bright track well visible in the center is very likely
due to a nuclear recoil induced by a neutron scattering.

\section{Cluster pattern recognition}
\label{sec:clustering}
The light produced in the multiplication process in the GEM and
detected by the sCMOS sensor is associated in clusters of neighboring
pixels. This is done by following the trail of energy deposition of
the particle traveling through the gas of the sensitive volume. The
deposited energy (that for stopped particles is equivalent to the
total energy of the particle) is estimated by the amount of the light
collected by the sensor.  Therefore, it is of primary importance to
have a reconstruction algorithm that includes all the camera pixels hit by
the real photons originating from the energy deposits, while rejecting
most of the electronic noise. This can either create fake clusters or,
more likely, add pixels in the periphery of clusters of real
photons, biasing the energy estimate.

The energy reconstruction follows a three-steps procedure: the
single-pixel noise suppression is briefly described in
Section~\ref{sec:zerosuppression}. This is followed by the proper
clustering: first the algorithm to form basic clusters from single
small deposits is described in Section~\ref{sec:basiccl}, then the
supercluster method, aiming to follow the full track pattern, and
seeded by the basic clusters, is described in
Section~\ref{sec:supercl}.

The results of this paper are based on the properties of the
reconstructed superclusters and are described in
Section~\ref{sec:clustershapes}.

 \section{Conclusion and outlook}

A method to efficiently identify recoiling nuclei after an elastic
scattering with fast neutrons with an optically readout TPC was
presented in this paper.  A 7 liter prototype was employed by exposing
its sensitive volume to two kinds of neutral particles in an
overground location:
\begin{itemize}
\item photons with energy of 5.9~\keV and 59~\keV respectively
  provided by a radioactive source of \fe and by one of $^{241}$Am
  able to produce electron recoils with equal energy by means of
  photoelectric effect;
\item neutrons with kinetic energy of few MeV produced by an \ambe
  source that can create nuclear recoils with kinetic energy lower
  than the neutron ones.
\end{itemize}

The high sensitivity of the adopted sCMOS optical sensor allowed a
very good efficiency in detecting events with an energy released in
gas even below 10~\keV.

Moreover, the possibility of exploiting the topological information
(shape, size and more) of clusters of emitted light permitted to
develop algorithms able to reconstruct not only the total released
energy, but also to identify the kind of the recoiling ionizing
particles in the gas (either an electron or a nucleus). Cosmic ray
long tracks are also clearly separated.

Because of their larger mass and electric charge, nuclear recoils are
expected to release their energy by ionizing the gas molecules in few
hundreds \unit{$\mu$m} while the electrons are able to travel longer
paths. For this reason, by exploiting the spatial distribution of the
collected light, it was possible to identify 5.9\keV electron recoils
with an efficiency of 96.5\% (99.2\%) against nuclear recoils by
retaining a capability of detecting them with an efficiency of 50\%
(40\%), averaged across the measured \ambe spectrum.

In average, nuclear recoils with a kinetic energy lower than 10\keV
can be detected with an efficiency of about 14\%.

The results obtained in the studies presented in this paper can be
improved by means of more sophisticated analyses exploiting a
multivariate approach, which combines a more complete topological
information about the light distribution along the tracks.  Additional
enhancement of sensitivity can be achieved with a DAQ system
collecting single PMT waveforms to be correlated with the track
reconstructed in the sCMOS images.
