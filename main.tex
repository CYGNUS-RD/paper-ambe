\section{Introduction}

The advent of a market of high position resolution and single photon
light sensors can open new opportunity to investigate ultra-low rate
phenomena as Dark Matter (DM) particle scattering on nuclei in a
gaseous target.

The nature of DM is still one of the key issues to understand our
Universe. Different models predicts the existence of neutral particles
with a mass of GeV or higher that would fill our Galaxy. They could
interact with the nuclei present in ordinary matter producing highly
ionizing nuclear recoils but with a kinetic energy as small as few
\keV. Moreover, given the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way towards
the Cygnus constellation such nuclear recoils would exhibit a dipole
angular distribution in a terrestrial detector.  In this paper we
describe the use of a scientific CMOS camera to capture the light
emitted by Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) in a Time Projection
Chamber (TPC) device. The GEMs are located in the TPC gas volume at
the anode position and are used to convert the ionization produced in
the gas by the nuclear recoils into flashes of visible light. The
flash of light and its shape can be located in space adopting a
cluster recognition algorithm. Neutron and $\gamma$ radiation emitted
by radioactive sources are used to set in motion atomic electrons and
nuclei respectively in the gas volume. Moreover, natural radiation as
cosmic rays is leaving a trail of ionization in the gas. They are all
producing different patterns of light emission from the GEMs that can
be reconstructed and analyzed. Nuclear recoils can then be efficiently
identified down to a few \keV kinetic energy.  The study of the
optical readout of TPC has been recently conducted with several small
size prototypes (NITEC~\cite{JINST:nitec},
ORANGE~\cite{NIM:Marafinietal, bib:jinst_orange2},
\lemon~\cite{bib:eps, bib:ieee17, bib:elba}) with various particles
sources. In the following, we report the study of nuclear recoils
excited by neutron from an \ambe source and electron recoils from a \fe
source in the gas volume of the \lemon prototype.

\section{Properties of the gas mixture}

Main parameters of the gas mixtures were studied by means of different
software packages. In particular,
\garfield~\cite{bib:garfield,bib:garfield1} was used to evaluate
transport properties for ionized electrons in sensitive volume for an
electric field of 500\unit{V/cm}.

Because of the diffusion in the gas, electrons produced a distance $z$
from the GEM, will occupy a region on the GEM surface with a gaussian
transverse profile and with a $\sigma_{\mathrm{T}}$ given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff}
\sigma_{\mathrm{T}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{\mathrm{T0}} \oplus D^2_{\mathrm{T}} \cdot z},
\end{equation}
where $D_{\mathrm{T}}$ is the transverse diffusion coefficients,
calculated to be
$D_{\mathrm{T}}^{60/40}~=~140~\frac{\mu{\mathrm{m}}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}}$.
The value of $\sigma^2_{\mathrm{T0}}$ was measured to be about
300\unit{$\mu$m} \cite{bib:btf,bib:fe55New}. Therefore, in average, a
point-like ionization will result in a spot of 3--4\unit{mm$^2$}.

Effective ranges of electron and He-nuclei recoils were calculated
respectively by \GEANTfour~\cite{GEANT4} and
\SRIM~\cite{bib:srim}. Results as a function of particle kinetic
energy are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:range}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item He-nuclei recoils have a sub-millimetre range up to energies
      of 100\keV and are thus expected to produce bright spots with
      sizes mainly dominated by diffusion effects;
    \item low energy (less than 10\keV) electron recoils are in
      general larger then He-nuclei recoils with same energy and are
      expected produce less intense spot-like signals. For a kinetic
      energy of 10\keV, the electron range becomes longer than
      1\unit{mm} and for few tens of \keV, tracks of few centimetres
      are expected.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\section{Experimental layout and data }
\label{sec:layout}
A 7 liter active sensitive volume TPC (named \lemon \cite{paperBTF})
was employed to detect the particles recoils. A sketch (not to scale)
of the detector setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon} (left), while a picture
of the real detector in the experimental area is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon} (right).

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\includegraphics[width=0.70\linewidth]{figures/lemon.png}
        \includegraphics[width=0.20\linewidth]{LEMON-Shielded.jpg}
  	\caption{Left: the \lemon prototype: the 7 liter sensitive
          volume (A), the PMT (B), the adjustable bellow (C) and the
          CMOS camera with its lens (D) are visible. Right: \lemon
          with the lead shield of the drift volume cage. The sCMOS
          camera (on the front) is looking at the GEMs through a
          blackened bellow.
  	\label{fig:lemon}}
\end{figure}
 
The sensitive volume where the ionization electrons are drifting
through features a 200$\times$240\unit{mm$^2$} elliptical field cage
with a 200 mm distance between the anode and the cathode. The anode
side is instrumented with a 200$\times$240\unit{mm$^2$} rectangular
triple GEM structure.  Standard LHCb-like \cite{bib:thesis} GEMs
(70\unit{$\mu$m} diameter holes and 140\unit{$\mu$m} pitch) were used
with two 2\unit{mm} wide transfer gaps between them. The light emitted
from the GEMs is detected with an ORCA-Flash 4.0 camera
\cite{ORCAcamera} through a $203\times254\times1$\unit{mm$^3$}
transparent window and a bellow with a adjustable length.  This camera
is positioned at a 52 cm distance from the outermost GEM layer and is
based on a sCMOS sensor with a high granularity ($2048\times2048$
pixels), very low noise (around two photons per pixel), high
sensitivity (70\% quantum efficiency at 600\unit{nm}) and good
linearity. This camera is instrumented with a Schneider lens (with an
aperture f/0.95 and a focal length of 25\unit{mm}). The lens is placed
at a distance $d$ of 50.6\unit{cm} from the last GEM in order to
obtain a de-magnification $\Delta = (d/f) - 1 = 19.25$ to image a
surface $25.6 \times 25.6$\unit{cm$^2$} onto the $1.33 \times
1.33$\unit{cm$^2$} sensor.  In this configuration, each pixel is
therefore imaging an effective area of 125$\times$125\unit{$\mu$m$^2$}
of the GEM layer. The fraction of the light collected by the lens can
be evaluated \cite{bib:jinst_orange1} to be $1.7 \times 10^{-4}$.

A semi-transparent mesh was used as a cathode in order to collect
light on that side also with a 50$\times$50\unit{mm$^2$} \textit{HZC
  Photonics XP3392} photomultiplier \cite{PMTPhotonics} (PMT)
detecting light through a transparent $50\times50\times4$\unit{mm$^3$}
fused silica window. More details can be found in Ref.~\cite{paperBTF}.




Typical images frame obtained with a 30\unit{ms} exposure time of the
sCMOS camera are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1}. Several light
spots are visible due to different ionization patterns due to
different types of particles interacting in the gas.
Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (left) shows an image with typical long
tracks from cosmic rays travelling through the full gas volume, where
clusters of light with larger energy deposition are clearly visible,
superimposed to radioactivity events likely due to natural origin.
Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (right) shows an example of a cleaner
event with one straight cosmic ray track, that can be used for energy
calibration purposes.

The events shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:signals} show images recorded with
the same 30 ms exposure time, but in presence of radioactive
sources. Figure~\ref{fig:signals} (left) shows one example of several
energy spots, characteristic of 5.9 keV energy deposits of a  \fe
radioactive $\gamma$-source.  This is the standard candle for calibration and
performance evaluation of \lemon, and its extensive use is documented in
Ref.~\cite{bib:fe55}. Figure~\ref{fig:signals} (right) shows an event
recorded in presence of the \ambe radioactive source, which emits neutrons in the 
$\alpha \, ^{9}Be \rightarrow \, n ^{12}C  \, \gamma$ reaction.

\lemon was operated in an overground location at Laboratori Nazionali
di Frascati (LNF) with a He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas mixture, the triple GEM
system set at a voltage across the GEM sides of 460\unit{V} and an
electric field between them of 2.5\unit{kV/cm}, using six independent HV
channels from a \textit{CAEN A1257} module
%a HV GEM power supply \cite{Corradi:2007df} 
ensuring stability and monitoring the bias currents with a precision
of 20\unit{nA}. The gas mixture was kept at atmospheric pressure under
continuous flow of about 200\unit{cc/min} and with the GEMs operated
at \textcolor{red}{2.0} $ \times10^6$ gain. The typical photon yield
for this type of gas mixtures has been measured to be around 0.07
photons per avalanche electron\cite{bib:jinst_orange1, bib:roby,
  bib:tesinatalia}. The field cage was powered by a \textit{CAEN
  N1570}~\cite{CAENN1570}, generating an electric field of 0.5~kV/cm.

The sCMOS sensor was operated in auto-trigger mode with a global
exposure time of 30\unit{ms}.  If, during the exposure time window,
the PMT signal exhibited a peak exceeding a threshold of 80\unit{mV},
the waveform was sent into a digitizer with a sampling frequency of
4\unit{GS/s} and acquired for a time window of 25\unit{$\mu$s}. The
digitizer was operated in single-event mode. No more than one signal
was recorded in each sCMOS exposure time. Therefore, PMT information
was mainly exploited to individuate events with cosmic ray tracks.

A 5\unit{cm} thick lead shielding was mounted around the \lemon field
cage to reduce the natural radioactivity background. From the
measurements of the GEM current with and without the lead shielding a
reduction of a factor 2 of the total ionization in the sensitive
volume, very likely due to external radioactivity, was estimated.

A neutron source, based on a $3.5\times10^3$\unit{MBq} activity
$^{241}$Am source contained in a Beryllium capsule (\ambe) was placed
at a distance of 50\unit{cm} from the sensitive volume side.  Because
of the interactions between $\alpha$ particles produced by the
$^{241}$Am and the Beryllium nucluei, the \ambe source isotropically
emits:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item photons with an energy of 59\keV produced by $^{241}$Am;
     \item neutrons with a kinetic energy mainly in a range between 1 to 10 MeV;
     \item photons with an energy of 4\MeV produced along with
       neutrons in the interaction between $\alpha$ and Be nucleus.
 \end{itemize}
The presence of a lead shield around the sensitive volume absorbed
almost completely the 59\keV photon component. A small faction of them
reached the gas through small gaps accidentally present between the
bricks.

\section{Cluster pattern recognition}
\label{sec:clustering}
The light produced in the multiplication process in the GEM and
detected by the sCMOS sensor is associated in clusters of neighboring
pixels. This is done by following the trail of energy deposition of
the particle travelling through the gas of the sensitive volume. The
deposited energy (that for stopped particles is equivalent to the
total energy of the particle) is estimated by the amount of the light
collected by the sensor.  Therefore, it is of primary importance to
have a reconstruction algorithm that includes all the pixels hit by
the real photons originating from the energy deposits, while rejecting
most of the electronic noise. This can either create fake clusters or,
more likely, add pixels in the periphery of clusters from real
photons, biasing the energy estimate.

The energy reconstruction follows a three-steps procedure: the
single-pixel noise suppression is briefly described in
Section~\ref{sec:zerosuppression}. This is followed by the proper
clustering: first the algorithm to form basic clusters from single
small deposits is described in Section~\ref{sec:basiccl}, then the
supercluster method, aiming to follow the full track pattern, and
seeded by the basic clusters, is described in
Section~\ref{sec:supercl}.

The results of this paper are based on the properties of the
reconstructed superclusters and are described in
Section~\ref{sec:clustershapes}.
