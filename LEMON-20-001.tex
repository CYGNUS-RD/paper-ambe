\begin{abstract}
The search for a novel technology able to detect and reconstruct
nuclear recoil events in the keV energy range has become more and more
important now that vast regions of high mass WIMP-like Dark Matter
candidate have been excluded.  Gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPC)
with optical readout are very promising candidates combining the
complete event information provided by the TPC technique with the high
sensitivity and granularity of last generation scientific light
sensors.  A TPC with an amplification at the anode obtained with Gas
Electron Multipliers (GEM) was tested at the Laboratori Nazionali di
Frascati. Photons and neutrons from radioactive sources were employed
to induce recoiling nuclei and electrons with kinetic energy in the
range [1--100]\keV.  A He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas mixture was used at
atmospheric pressure and the light produced during the multiplication
in the GEM channels was acquired by a high position resolution and low
noise scientific CMOS camera and a photomultiplier. A multi-stage
pattern recognition algorithm based on an advanced clustering
technique is presented here. A number of cluster shape observables are
used to identify nuclear recoils induced by neutrons originated from a
\ambe source against X-ray \fe photo-electrons. An efficiency of 18\%
to detect nuclear recoils with an energy of about 6 keV is reached
while suppressing 96\% of the \fe photoelectrons. This makes this
optically read out gas TPC a very promising candidate for future
investigations of ultra-rare events as directional direct Dark Matter
searches.

\section{Introduction}

The advent of a market of single-photon light sensors with high
position resolution can open new opportunities to investigate
ultra-low rate phenomena as Dark Matter (DM) particle scattering on
nuclei in a gaseous target.

The nature of DM is still one of the key issues to understand our
Universe \cite{PhysRevLett.39.165,Undagoitia_2015}.  Different models
predict the existence of neutral particles with a mass of few GeV or
higher that would fill our Galaxy
\cite{PhysRevLett.113.171301,PhysRevD.79.115016,doi:10.1142/S0217751X13300287,ZUREK201491}. They
could interact with the nuclei present in ordinary matter producing
highly ionizing nuclear recoils but with a kinetic energy as small as
few keV. Moreover, given the motion of the Sun in the Milky Way
towards the Cygnus constellation, such nuclear recoils would exhibit
in galactic coordinates a dipole angular distribution in a terrestrial
detector \cite{MAYET20161}.  In this paper the use of a scientific
CMOS camera to capture the light emitted by Gas Electron Multipliers
(GEMs) in a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) device is described. The
GEMs are located in the TPC gas volume at the anode position and are
used to amplify the ionization produced in the gas by the nuclear
recoils and other particles. A secondary scintillation light is
produced in the amplification of the avalanche process by the GEM.
This light and its spatial distribution are reconstructed in the
detector and characterized by means of a clustering algorithm.


Different type of particles will produce distinctive and diverse
patterns of ionization charge, and therefore of light emitted by the
GEMs, given the different way they deposit energy and interact with
matter.  Therefore, nuclear recoils can be efficiently identified and
separated from different kinds of background down to a few \keV
kinetic energy.  The study of the optical readout of a TPC has been
recently conducted with several small size prototypes
(NITEC~\cite{JINST:nitec},
ORANGE~\cite{NIM:Marafinietal,bib:jinst_orange2},
\lemon~\cite{bib:eps, bib:ieee17,bib:elba}) with various particle
sources, in the context of the \cygno
project~\cite{Abritta_Costa_2020,CYGNOweb}, as well as alternative
experiments, as ARIADNE~\cite{Roberts_2019}. In the following, the
study of nuclear recoils excited by neutrons from an \ambe source and
electron recoils from a \fe source in the gas volume of the \lemon
prototype is presented.



\section{Experimental layout}
\label{sec:layout}
A 7 liter active sensitive volume TPC (named \lemon) was employed to
detect the particle recoils. A sketch (not to scale) of the detector
setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon} (left), while an image of the
detector in the experimental area is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lemon}
(right).

\end{figure}
%
The sensitive volume where the ionization electrons are drifting
features a 200$\times$240\unit{mm$^2$} elliptical field cage with a
200 mm distance between the anode and the cathode. The anode side is
instrumented with a $200{\times}240$\unit{mm$^2$} rectangular triple
GEM structure.  Standard LHCb-like GEMs (70\unit{$\mu$m} diameter
holes and 140\unit{$\mu$m} pitch)~\cite{bib:thesis} were used with two
2\unit{mm} wide transfer gaps between them. The light emitted from the
GEMs is detected with an \texttt{ORCA-Flash~4.0} camera \cite{ORCAcamera}
through a $203{\times}254{\times}1$\unit{mm$^3$} transparent window
and a bellows of adjustable length.  This camera is positioned at a 52
cm distance from the outermost GEM layer and is based on a sCMOS
sensor with high granularity ($2048{\times}2048$ pixels), very low
noise (around two photons per pixel), high sensitivity (70\% quantum
efficiency at 600\unit{nm}) and good
linearity~\cite{bib:jinst_orange1}. This camera is instrumented with a
Schneider lens, characterized by an aperture f/0.95 and a focal length
of 25\unit{mm}. The lens is placed at a distance $d=50.6$\unit{cm}
from the last GEM in order to obtain a de-magnification $\Delta =
(d/f) - 1 = 19.25$ to image a surface $25.6{\times}25.6$\unit{cm$^2$}
onto the $1.33{\times}1.33$\unit{cm$^2$} sensor.  In this
configuration, each pixel is therefore imaging an effective area of
$125{\times}125$\unit{$\mu$m$^2$} of the GEM layer. The fraction of
the light collected by the lens is evaluated
to be $1.7{\times}10^{-4}$~\cite{bib:jinst_orange1}.
%
A semi-transparent mesh was used as a cathode in order to collect
light on that side also with a $50{\times}50$\unit{mm$^2$}
\texttt{HZC~Photonics~XP3392} photomultiplier~\cite{PMTPhotonics}
(PMT) detecting light through a transparent
$50{\times}50{\times}4$\unit{mm$^3$} fused silica window. More details
on the \lemon detector can be found in Ref.~\cite{paperBTF}.

A 5\unit{cm} thick lead shielding was mounted around the \lemon field
cage to reduce the environmental natural radioactivity
background. From the measurements of the GEM current with and without
the lead shielding, a factor two reduction in the total ionization
within the sensitive volume, very likely due to environmental
radioactivity, was estimated.


\section{Particle images in the \lemon gas volume}

The \lemon detector was operated in an overground location at
Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (LNF) with a He-CF$_4$ (60/40) gas
mixture at atmospheric pressure, the triple GEM system set at a
voltage across each GEM sides of 460\unit{V} and a transfer field
between the GEM layers of 2.5\unit{kV/cm}.  A \texttt{CAEN} model
\texttt {SY1527} high-voltage module with six independent channels
ensured stability and monitored the bias currents with a precision of
20\unit{nA}. The gas mixture was kept under continuous flow of about
200\unit{cc/min} and with the GEMs operated at a $2.0\times10^6$
electric gain. The typical photon yield for this type of gas mixtures
has been measured to be around 0.07 photons per avalanche
electron\cite{bib:jinst_orange1, bib:roby, bib:tesinatalia} and
therefore the overall light gain is about $10^6$. The field cage was
powered by a \texttt{CAEN~N1570}~\cite{CAENN1570}, generating an
electric field of 0.5~kV/cm.
  
The motion of particles within the gas mixtures was studied by means
of different simulation tools. In particular,
\garfield~\cite{bib:garfield,bib:garfield1} program was used to
evaluate the transport properties for ionization electrons in the
sensitive volume for an electric field of 500\unit{V/cm}.

Given the diffusion in the gas, ionization electrons produced at a
distance $z$ from the GEM will distribute over a region on the GEM
surface, having a Gaussian transverse profile with a $\sigma$ given
by:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:diff}
\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2_0 \oplus D^2 \cdot z},
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the transverse diffusion coefficient, whose value at room
temperature 140\unit{$\mu{\mathrm{m}}/\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}}$} was
obtained with a simulation.  The value of $\sigma_0$ was measured to
be about 300\unit{$\mu$m} \cite{bib:btf,bib:fe55New}. Therefore, in
average, a point-like ionization will result in a spot of
3--4\unit{mm$^2$}.

The expected effective ranges of electron and nuclear recoils were
evaluated respectively with \GEANTfour~\cite{GEANT4} and with
\SRIM~\cite{bib:srim} simulation programs. The recoil range estimated
from simulation, as a function of the impinging particle kinetic
energy, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:range} for electrons and -as an
example- for He-nuclei.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figures/range_ER_NR.pdf}
    \caption{Average ranges for electron and He-nucleus recoils as a
      function of their initial kinetic energy. Lines in the figure are guide for the eye.
      \label{fig:range}}
      \end{center}
\end{figure}
%
These results show that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item He-nuclei recoils have a sub-millimeter range up to energies
      of 100\keV and are thus expected to produce bright spots with
      sizes mainly dominated by diffusion;
    \item low energy (less than 10\keV) electron recoils are in
      general longer than He-nucleus recoils with same energy and are
      expected to produce sparse and less intense spot-like signals. For a
      kinetic energy of 10\keV, the electron range becomes longer than
      1\unit{mm} and for few tens of keV, tracks of few cm are
      expected.
\end{itemize}

 The images collected by the sCMOS camera contain several instances of
 the particles tracks described above. The sCMOS sensor was operated
 in continuous mode with a global exposure time of
 30\unit{ms}. Example images are shown in
 Fig.~\ref{fig:typicalimage1}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figures/pic_run02317_ev8_oriIma_paper}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\linewidth]{figures/pic_run02156_ev527_oriIma_paper}
    \caption{Two example pictures taken with the sCMOS camera with a
      30\unit{ms} exposure time and with a common noise level
      subtracted (zero suppression), belonging to a data taking run
      without any artificial source. Left: cosmic tracks and natural
      radioactivity signals are present. Right: only two long cosmic
      rays tracks are visible. The coordinates are defined such that
      the vertical direction is along the y-axis and cosmic rays are
      expected to come from the top of the figure.
      \label{fig:typicalimage1}}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The PMT waveform was sent to a digitizer board with a sampling
frequency of 4\unit{GS/s}. The trigger scheme of the detector is based
on the PMT signal: if, during the exposure time window, the PMT
waveform exhibits a peak exceeding a threshold of 80\unit{mV}, it is
acquired in a time window of 25\unit{$\mu$s} and the corresponding
sCMOS image is stored.  The digitizer is operated in single-event
mode. No more than one 25\unit{$\mu$s} long PMT waveform is recorded
in each sCMOS exposure time, even if during the sCMOS exposure time
several PMT signals are produced.  Therefore, the PMT information was
mainly exploited only to select frames with a cosmic-ray track.



Several light spots are visible with different ionization patterns due
to different types of particles interacting in the gas.
Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (left) shows an image with typical long
tracks from cosmic rays traveling through the full gas volume, where
clusters of light with larger energy deposition are clearly visible,
superimposed to low energy electrons, very likely due to natural
radioactivity.  Figure~\ref{fig:typicalimage1} (right) shows an
example of a cleaner event with two straight cosmic ray tracks, that
can be used for energy calibration purposes, since the energy releases
along the path, $dE/dx$, can be predicted given the gas mixture and
pressure.

Two different artificial radioactive sources were employed for testing
and studying the detector responses.

\vspace{10pt}

A {\bf neutron} source, based on a $3.5{\times}10^3$\unit{MBq} activity
$^{241}$Am source contained in a Beryllium capsule (\ambe) was placed
at a distance of 50\unit{cm} from the sensitive volume side.  Because
of the interactions between $\alpha$ particles produced by the
$^{241}$Am and the Beryllium nuclei, the \ambe source isotropically
emits:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item photons with an energy of 59\keV produced by $^{241}$Am;
     \item neutrons with a kinetic energy mainly in a range
       [1--10]\MeV
     \item photons with an energy of 4.4\MeV produced along with
       neutrons in the interaction between $\alpha$ and Be nucleus.
 \end{itemize}
 The presence of a lead shield around the sensitive volume absorbed
almost completely the 59\keV photon component. A small faction of it
reached the gas through small gaps accidentally present between the lead
bricks.

\vspace{10pt}

A \fe source emitting {\bf X-rays} with a main energy peak at 5.9\keV.
This is the standard candle for calibration and performance evaluation
of \lemon, and its extensive use is documented in
Ref.~\cite{bib:fe55}.

\vspace{10pt}

Four different sets of runs have been recorded: (i) without any source
and no electric signal amplification in the GEMs, to study the sensor
electronic noise; (ii) without any source, but the detector fully
active, to study the ambient background, mainly muons from cosmic rays
and natural radioactivity; runs with either the (iii) \fe source, to
study the detector response to a known signal or with the \ambe
source, to study the \lemon performances in presence of nuclear
recoils.


\vspace{10pt}

Figure~\ref{fig:signals} shows images recorded with the same
30\unit{ms} exposure time, in presence of one of the two sources. The
left panel shows an example of several light spots, characteristic of
energy deposits due to \fe low energy photons.  The right panel shows
a frame recorded in presence of the \ambe radioactive source: the
short and bright track well visible in the center is very likely due
to an energetic nuclear recoil induced by a neutron scattering.

\section{Cluster reconstruction algorithm}
\label{sec:clustering}
The light produced in the multiplication process through the GEMs and
detected by the sCMOS sensor is associated in clusters of neighboring
pixels. This is achieved by following the trail of energy deposition
of the particle traveling through the gas of the sensitive volume. The
energy released as ionization electrons is estimated by the amount of
the light collected by the sensor.  In the range from few keV to tens
of keV for stopped electrons, the deposited energy is equivalent to
their total kinetic energy, while for stopped nuclei it represent only
a fraction of their initial kinetic energy.  Therefore, it is of
primary importance to have a reconstruction algorithm that includes
all the camera pixels hit by the real photons originating from the
energy deposits, while rejecting most of the electronic noise from the
camera sensor. Noise can either create fake clusters or, more likely,
add pixels in the periphery of clusters originated by real photons,
thus biasing the energy estimate.  Possible additional noise, arising
for example from GEM stages, was already demonstrated be negligible
\cite{bib:fe55}.

The energy reconstruction follows a three-steps procedure: the
single-pixel noise suppression is briefly described in
Section~\ref{sec:zerosuppression}. This is followed by the proper
clustering: first the algorithm to form basic clusters from single
small deposits is described in Section~\ref{sec:basiccl}, then the
supercluster method, aiming to follow the full particle track, and
seeded by the basic clusters found in the previous step, is described
in Section~\ref{sec:supercl}.

The results of this paper are based on the properties of the
reconstructed superclusters and are described in
Section~\ref{sec:clustershapes}.

 \section{Conclusion and outlook}

A method to efficiently identify recoiling nuclei after an elastic
scattering with fast neutrons with an optically readout TPC was
presented in this paper.  A 7 liter prototype was employed by exposing
its sensitive volume to two kinds of neutral particles in an
overground location:
\begin{itemize}
\item photons with energy of 5.9~\keV and 59~\keV respectively
  provided by a radioactive source of \fe and by one of $^{241}$Am
  able to produce electron recoils with equal energy by means of
  photoelectric effect;
\item neutrons with kinetic energy of few MeV produced by an \ambe
  source that can create nuclear recoils with kinetic energy lower
  than the neutron ones.
\end{itemize}

The high sensitivity of the adopted sCMOS optical sensor allowed a
very good efficiency in detecting events with an energy released in
gas even below 10~\keV.

Moreover, the possibility of exploiting the topological information
(shape, size and more) of clusters of emitted light allowed to develop
algorithms able to reconstruct not only the total deposited energy,
but also to identify the kind of the recoiling ionizing particles in
the gas (either an electron or a nucleus). Cosmic ray long tracks are
also clearly separated.

Because of their larger mass and electric charge, nuclear recoils are
expected to release their energy by ionizing the gas molecules in few
hundreds \unit{$\mu$m} while the electrons are able to travel longer
paths. For this reason, by exploiting the spatial distribution of the
collected light, it was possible to identify 5.9\keV electron recoils
with an efficiency of 96.5\% (99.2\%) against nuclear recoils by
retaining a capability of detecting them with an efficiency of 50\%
(40\%), averaged across the measured \ambe spectrum.

In particular, the nuclear recoil detection efficiency was measured to
be 40\% for deposited energies lower than 20\keV and 14\% in the range
(5--10)\keV.

The results obtained in the studies presented in this paper can be
improved by means of more sophisticated analyses exploiting a
multivariate approach, which combines a more complete topological
information about the light distribution along the tracks.  Additional
enhancement of sensitivity can be achieved with a DAQ system
collecting single PMT waveforms to be correlated with the track
reconstructed in the sCMOS images.
