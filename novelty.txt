The work presented in this article demonstrates the ability to
reconstruct efficiently nuclear recoils down to an energy of few
keVs, by using the novel experimental technique of a Time Projection
Chamber, where the readout grounds on the detection by a CMOS camera
of the light produced during the charge multiplication in triple GEM
planes. The novelty of the work consists in the algorithm to
reconstruct the clusters of light by a sophisticated pattern
recognition algorithm, and its ability to distinguish between
different types of particle interactions, like nuclear or electron
recoils down to an energy of 6 keV.
