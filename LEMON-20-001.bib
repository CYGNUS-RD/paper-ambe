	title = {Dark matter direct-detection experiments},
	journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
	abstract = {In recent decades, several detector technologies have been developed with the quest to directly detect dark matter interactions and to test one of the most important unsolved questions in modern physics. The sensitivity of these experiments has improved with a tremendous speed due to a constant development of the detectors and analysis methods, proving uniquely suited devices to solve the dark matter puzzle, as all other discovery strategies can only indirectly infer its existence. Despite the overwhelming evidence for dark matter from cosmological indications at small and large scales, clear evidence for a particle explaining these observations remains absent. This review summarises the status of direct dark matter searches, focusing on the detector technologies used to directly detect a dark matter particle producing recoil energies in the keV energy scale. The phenomenological signal expectations, main background sources, statistical treatment of data and calibration strategies are discussed.}

They are largely motivated by the observed similarity in the mass densities of dark and visible matter, with the former observed to be about five times the latter. This review discusses the construction of asymmetric dark matter models, summarizes cosmological and astrophysical bounds, and touches on direct detection prospects and collider signatures. }

While there are many models of ADM in the literature, our review of existing models will center on highlighting the few common features and important mechanisms for generation and transfer of the matter–anti-matter asymmetry between dark and visible sectors. We also survey ADM hidden sectors, the calculation of the relic abundance for ADM, and how the DM asymmetry may be erased at late times through oscillations. We consider cosmological constraints on ADM from the cosmic microwave background, neutron stars, the Sun, and brown and white dwarves. Lastly, we review indirect and direct detection methods for ADM, collider signatures, and constraints."

abstract = "Cosmological observations indicate that most of the matter in the Universe is Dark Matter. Dark Matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) can be detected directly, via its elastic scattering off target nuclei. Most current direct detection experiments only measure the energy of the recoiling nuclei. However, directional detection experiments are sensitive to the direction of the nuclear recoil as well. Due to the Sun’s motion with respect to the Galactic rest frame, the directional recoil rate has a dipole feature, peaking around the direction of the Solar motion. This provides a powerful tool for demonstrating the Galactic origin of nuclear recoils and hence unambiguously detecting Dark Matter. Furthermore, the directional recoil distribution depends on the WIMP mass, scattering cross section and local velocity distribution. Therefore, with a large number of recoil events it will be possible to study the physics of Dark Matter in terms of particle and astrophysical properties. We review the potential of directional detectors for detecting and characterizing WIMPs."

This is part of the CYGNUS proto-collaboration which aims at constructing a network of underground observatories for directional Dark Matter search. The combined use of high-granularity sCMOS and fast sensors for reading out the light produced in GEM channels during the multiplication processes was shown to allow on one hand to reconstruct 3D direction of the tracks, offering accurate energy measurements and sensitivity to the source directionality and, on the other hand, a high particle identification capability very useful to distinguish nuclear recoils. Results of the performed R&D and future steps toward a 30-100 cubic meter experiment will be presented.}

In a volume of 2000 m3 of CF4 at normal pressure and room temperature, which corresponds to a mass of 7.4 ton, we expect ~ 3300 of such events per year. The detector can give the spectrum of the low energy neutrinos from the Sun and it can identify solar neutrinos of different origin: pp, 7Be, and, eventually, 8B. We find that 14C is a possible severe source of background: it is necessary to have a ratio 14C/12C lower than 10−19 in order to be able to identify the pp neutrinos."

Proposed applications for low-energy and rare event studies, such as Dark Matter search, ask for demanding performance in the keV energy range. The performance of such a readout was studied in details as a function of the electric field configuration and GEM gain by using a 55Fe source within a 7 litre sensitive volume detector developed as a part of the R&D for the CYGNUS project. Results reported in this paper show that the low noise level of the sensor allows to operate with a 2 keV threshold while keeping a rate of fake-events lesser than 10 per year. In this configuration, a detection efficiency well above 95% along with an energy resolution (σ) of 18%  is obtained for the 5.9 keV photons  demonstrating the very promising capabilities of this technique.}

	journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
	abstract = {The semiconductor pixel detector Timepix contains an array of 256  ×  256 square pixels with pitch 55 μm. In addition to high spatial granularity the single quantum counting detector Timepix can provide also energy or time information in each pixel. This device is a powerful tool for radiation and particle detection, imaging and tracking. A new readout interface for silicon pixel detectors of the Medipix family has been developed in our group in order to provide a higher frame rate and enhanced flexibility of operation. The interface consists of a field programmable gate array, a USB 2.0 interface chip, DAC, ADC and a circuit which generates bias voltage for the sensor. The main control system is 
placed in the FPGA circuit which fully controls the Timepix device. This 
approach offers an easy way how to include new functionality and extended 
operation. The interface for Timepix supports all operation modes of the 
detector (counting, TOT, timing). The FITPix is a successor of the USB 1.22 
Interface and the electronic readout is built with the latest available 
components, which allows achieving up to 90 frames per second with a single 
detector. The frame rate is about 20 times faster compared to the previous 
system while it maintains all same capabilities supported. In addition 
FITPix newly enables an adjustable clock frequency and hardware triggering 
which is a useful tool when there is the need for synchronized operation of 
multiple devices. Three modes of hardware trigger have been implemented: 
hardware trigger which starts the measurement, hardware trigger which 
terminates the measurement and hardware trigger which controls measurement 
fully. The entire system is fully powered through the USB bus. FITPix 
supports also readout from several detectors in chain in which case just an 
external power source is required. FITPix is a fully flexible device and the 
user needs no other equipment. FITPix combines high performance and mobility 
and it opens new fields of applications. The current version of the FITPix 
interface has dimension 45 mm  ×  60 mm.}

This gas has recently received attention   in the context of directional Dark Matter searches, thanks to its   high Fluorine content, reduced diffusion and multiple species of   charge carriers, which allow for full detector fiducialization. Our   measurements, performed with a 5 cm drift distance Negative Ion Time   Projection Chamber, show the possibility of negative ion operation   in pure SF6 between 75 and 150 Torr with triple thin GEM   amplification, confirming the attractive potentialities of this   gas. Above all, our results with the mixture He:CF4:SF6 360:240:10 Torr demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of   SF6− negative ion drift and gas gain in He at nearly   atmospheric pressure, opening very interesting prospects for the   next generation of directional Dark Matter detectors.}

abstract="This work proposes to evaluate the effect of digital filters when applied to images acquired by the ORANGE prototype of the Cygno experiment. A preliminary analysis is presented in order to understand if filtering techniques can produce results that justify investing efforts in the pre-processing stage of those images. Such images come from a camera sensor based on CMOS technology installed in an appropriate gas detector. To perform the proposed work, a simulation environment was created and used to evaluate some of the classical filtering techniques known in the literature. The results showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of the images can be considerably improved, which may help in subsequent processing steps such as clustering and particles identification.",
